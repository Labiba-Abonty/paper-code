## Experiment materials for the paper "*Detecting Privacy Concerns Related Features From App Reviews*"

### Introduction

This repository includes all the materials (code, input data, evaluation results, output results) of our proposed *semi-automatic framework for detecting privacy concerns related features*. Those materials involve four components of our framework: *reviews retrieval*, *reviews classification*, *feature extraction*, and *feature matching*.

### File Descriptions

There are four directories in total, and the content of each directory is described as follows:

`code`: the source code of *reviews retrieval*, *reviews classification*, *feature extraction*, and *feature matching*.

`data`: the input data of *reviews retrieval*, *reviews classification*, *feature extraction*, and *feature matching*.

`evaluate`: the evaluation results of *reviews retrieval*, *reviews classification*, *feature extraction*, and *feature matching*.

`result`: the output of *reviews retrieval*, *reviews classification*, *feature extraction*, and *feature matching*.

### Running Environment

The experiments can be conducted in both local Windows machines and Kaggle cloud servers.

We recommend the Python programming environment as follows:

- Anaconda 3.X
- Jupyter-lab
- Python 3.X
- Scikit-learn
- Sentence-transformers
- Hugging Face
